# Simple Merchant

This will be ready by May 1st.

Simple Merchant is a drop in asset for Unity games.  
How does it work?
1. Add a list of items in your game.
2. Drop a Simple Merchant into your game.
3. Set some items in the inspector and your merchant is live in the game.

Simple Merchant relies on Simple Inventory and Simple Manager, both of which are embedded within Simple Merchant.

This page will be changed into a tutorial when the asset is fully complete.
